**Note:** The PatternFly ChatBot extension lives in its own package [`@patternfly/chatbot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/chatbot)

It is important to leverage AI in a way that improves the experiences of your users. In alignment with our [AI principles](/patternfly-ai/about-ai#ai-principles) and [ethical design guidelines,](/patternfly-ai/ai-guidelines) we've created this ChatBot extension. The PatternFly ChatBot contains a React implementation of an AI ChatBot, to provide your users with access to convenient and persistent help.

_Only use this ChatBot when it adds value to your users' experiences._ Don't use it simply for the sake of novelty&mdash;your users will only be excited to interact with a new ChatBot feature if it directly helps them reach their goals.

## How to use the ChatBot
