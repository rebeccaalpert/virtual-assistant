**Note:** The PatternFly ChatBot extension lives in its own package [`@patternfly/chatbot`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@patternfly/chatbot).

The PatternFly **ChatBot** extension contains a React implementation of an AI-focused chatbot, providing users with access to convenient and persistent help. This extension is intended to remain in alignment with our [AI principles and design guidelines](/ai/overview).

*Only use this ChatBot when it adds value to your users' experiences.* Don't use it simply for the sake of novelty&mdash;it must directly help users reach their goals.

## How do I use ChatBot? 

To get started:
1. Install the `@patternfly/chatbot` package by following [the README instructions](https://github.com/patternfly/chatbot).
2. To use a ChatBot component in your project, import the ChatBot and the  component you need. For example: `import ChatbotWelcomePrompt from '@patternfly/chatbot/dist/dynamic/ChatbotWelcomePrompt';`
3. To build out and customize your ChatBot experience, refer to our extensive documentation on PatternFly.org.

## What does a built-out ChatBot look like?

To illustrate holistic ChatBot solutions, we offer these interactive demos: 
- [Basic ChatBot](/extensions/chatbot/overview/demo#basic-chatbot): A standard ChatBot that can swap between display modes.
- [Compact ChatBot](/extensions/chatbot/overview/demo#compact-chatbot): A compact version of a standard ChatBot that allows for more information density. 
- [Embedded ChatBot](/extensions/chatbot/overview/demo#embedded-chatbot): A ChatBot experience that can be embedded into a page within an application.
- [Inline drawer ChatBot](/extensions/chatbot/overview/demo#inline-drawer-chatbot): A ChatBot placed within a drawer that is inline with page content, rather than one that overlays the page.
